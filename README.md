# Keybinds
Check out all the default [Keybinds](https://github.com/7eventy7/STABILITY-COUNTER-STRIKE-CONFIG/blob/main/KEYBINDS.md) available in this config by reviewing the `autoexec.cfg` file.

> It's a good idea to review the keybinds before changing them during installation.     
> Failing to do so can result in overwriting keybinds and causing various issues.
